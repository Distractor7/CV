      My name is Jordan Bendon and I am a 24 year old aspiring Software and Web
      Developer. I was born in Ireland but was raised in South Africa. I have
      always considered myself a creative person as I have been drawn to almost
      all forms of art and design all of my life. I am deeply interested in
      illustrating, writing and music in particular has had a special place in
      my life since a young age. <br />

      I also consider myself a social person and am motivated by a deep desire
      to interact with, learn from and help people. It's because of these
      features of my peronality that I have found Software and Web Development

      design accompanied by my enthusiam in helping and working with people make
      me very excited to be in this field.
